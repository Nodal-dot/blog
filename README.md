# Nodal-dot Blog

This is my personal website and portfolio blog. It has both English and Russian content, a small custom design system, and a few interactive sections that I built by hand instead of dropping in a ready-made template.

- Routing and locale handling are built around `next-intl`.
- Most animations and interactive pieces were implemented manually for this project.
